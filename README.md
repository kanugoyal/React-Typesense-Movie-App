## React ElasticSearch InstantSearch

### Motivation:
This project was created to learn the fundamental functionalities of Elasticsearch within a React application and specifically explore the real-time search capabilities using react-instantsearch. The primary motivation was to grasp how Elasticsearch performs search operations efficiently and promptly as the user types, and to understand the integration process of Elasticsearch in a React environment.

### Tech Description:
- React: A JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It provides a flexible and efficient way to create interactive components.
- Elasticsearch: A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine designed for horizontal scalability, reliability, and real-time search functionality.
- react-instantsearch: A set of components and helpers to build a search interface with Elasticsearch. It allows for real-time search experiences in React applications by enabling instant updates as users input their queries.

### Features:
- Real-time Search: Utilizes Elasticsearch and react-instantsearch to achieve real-time search results as users type.
- Responsive Interface: Ensures compatibility across various screen sizes and devices.
- Simple and Intuitive UI: Provides a user-friendly interface for search functionality.

### Usage: (https://kanugoyal.github.io/React-Typesense-Movie-App/)
- Access the application via the provided URL after starting the development server.
- Input search queries in the designated search bar.
- Observe the real-time search results updating dynamically as you type.
